    <h2>My summer journey 2018:</h2>     
        <p>The journey took us from the colonial streets of  <span style="color:blue">Santo Domingo</span> to the beautiful beaches of the North Coast –<span style="color:blue">Santo Domingo Puerto Plata and Sosua </span>– stopping along the way to explore the off-beaten path towns.
           The Dominican Republic has so much to offer that my seven-day trip felt short. With breathtaking mountain scenery, vivid colonial streets, beach galore, valleys of lush tropical rainforests, and even arid semi-deserts, the Caribbean country has something for everybody!</p>

                            swaths of cinematic beaches faster than the real estate agents can get the sun-soaked sands on the market.
                            The beaches along the coastline from Punta Cana to El Macao rival those anywhere else in the 
                            Caribbean, both in terms of their soft, white texture and their warm aquamarine waters.
                            Despite a lack of restraint on development in the area, the resorts and beaches here still manage to 
                            offer an idyllic Caribbean seascape for a seemingly endless crowd of sunseekers. </p>

Known for its well-populated coral reefs, Catalina is a peaceful respite for those looking to escape bustling Punta Cana and La Romana.
                    The Basics
                    Catalina Island is home to a diverse ecosystem of sand dunes, mangroves, and reefs populated by many species of sea birds and tropical fish. The island’s main draws are its white sandy beaches and its beautiful underwater ecosystem. Snorkeling and scuba diving are particularly good here, and the Wall and the Aquarium are two of the top dive sites. </p>

                <td><p>Santo Domingo, or ‘La Capital’ as it’s typically called, is a collage of cultures and neighborhoods. It’s where the sounds of life – domino pieces slapped on tables, backfiring mufflers and horns from chaotic traffic, merengue and bachata blasting from corner stores – are most intense. At the heart of the city is the Zona Colonial, where you’ll find one of the oldest churches and the oldest surviving European fortress, among other New World firsts. Amid the cobblestone streets it would be easy to forget Santo Domingo is in the Caribbean. But this is an intensely urban city, home not only to colonial-era architecture, but also to hot clubs, vibrant cultural institutions and elegant restaurants. Santo Domingo somehow manages to embody the contradictions central to the Dominican experience: a living museum, a metropolis crossed with a seaside resort, and a business, political and media center with a laid-back, affable spirit. </p></td>

                <strong> What do we eat and drinks?</strong></br>
                Dominicans call their cuisine comida criolla and it’s a delicious – if often rather greasy – blend of Spanish, African and Taino elements, with interesting regional variants across the island. Dishes usually include rice and beans – referred to locally as la bandera dominicana (the Dominican flag) – using either habichuelas (red beans) or the tiny black peas known as morros. Most often the rice is supplemented with chicken either fried, grilled or served asopao (in a rich, soupy sauce). Invariably main courses come with plátanos (deep-fried green plantains), which locals often inundate with ketchup and a small coleslaw salad.</br>
                Mama Juana (or Mamajuana) is a drink from the Dominican Republic that is concocted by allowing rum, red wine, and honey to soak in a bottle with tree bark and herbs. The taste is similar to port wine and the color is a deep red.
